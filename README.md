# Secure-Model-Optimization
Machine learning has found extensive application in several sectors of smart healthcare sectors that collect vast amounts of data from multiple IoT devices. Among the commonly used machine learning (ML) models and ensemble learning (EL) models, they are effective for data classification and have been employed in various real-world scenarios like anomaly detection and disease diagnosis. However, training ML and EL models like AdaBoost, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Extra Trees Classifier (ETC), and Decision Tree (DT) typically necessitates obtaining labeled IoT data from numerous sources, resulting in concerns over data privacy. Current solutions assume that training data can be securely collected from multiple providers, which is often not the case in reality.
This prooject proposes a solution to reconcile the discrepancy between ideal assumptions and practical limitations by employing homomorphic encryption for secure data-sharing among multiple data providers. The platform encrypts IoT data. Through a rigorous security analysis, we confirm that the proposed scheme upholds the confidentiality of sensitive data for individual data providers, as well as the AdaBoost, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Extra Trees Classifier, and Decision Trees models parameters for data analysts. Furthermore, extensive experiments showcase the efficiency of the proposed approach using ANN.
