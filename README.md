# Secure-Model-Optimization
Abstractâ€”
Machine learning has found extensive application in several sectors of smart healthcare sectors that collect vast amounts of data from multiple IoT devices. Among the commonly used machine learning (ML) models and ensemble learning (EL) models, they are effective for data classification and have been employed in various real-world scenarios like anomaly detection and disease diagnosis. However, training ML and EL models like AdaBoost, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Extra Trees Classifier (ETC), and Decision Tree (DT) typically necessitates obtaining labeled IoT data from numerous sources, resulting in concerns over data privacy. Current solutions assume that training data can be securely collected from multiple providers, which is often not the case in reality.
This article proposes a solution to reconcile the discrepancy between ideal assumptions and practical limitations by employing blockchain technology to establish a dependable and secure data-sharing platform among multiple data providers. The platform encrypts IoT data and records it on a decentralized ledger. Through a rigorous security analysis, we confirm that the proposed scheme upholds the confidentiality of sensitive data for individual data providers, as well as the AdaBoost, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Extra Trees Classifier, and Decision Trees models parameters for data analysts. Furthermore, extensive experiments showcase the efficiency of the proposed approach. 

The surge in smart healthcare has driven the widespread adoption of advanced Internet-of-Things (IoT) infrastructures, generating vast amounts of data across various sectors, including transportation, manufacturing, energy, and agriculture. To manage the extensive data processing needs, machine learning (ML) and ensemble learning (EL) technologies have become essential. Prominent ML models like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Decision Tree, ExtraTrees Classifier, and AdaBoost offer solutions for various classification challenges in IoT-enabled smart healthcare. These models facilitate precise diagnosis from wearable IoT sensor data and detect anomalies in network traffic data. However, training these models effectively requires large, diverse datasets, which single entities often lack. Data sharing among entities is hindered by privacy, integrity, and ownership concerns. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a blockchain-based secure data-sharing platform, ensuring data privacy and integrity while enabling efficient ML model training. Our approach leverages blockchain's tamper-proof nature for secure data recording and auditing, and extensive experiments validate the accuracy and confidentiality of trained models. This integration of blockchain with ML aims to advance secure and collaborative data utilization in smart healthcare.
